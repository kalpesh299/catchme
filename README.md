# catchme

Created this project to do HandsOn Practice on keyevent


* A simple web application we can use just to do some fun with friends built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Responsive design for desktop devices.
- Minimalistic and user-friendly interface.
- Responsiveness: While this static webpage doesn't currently employ media queries for responsiveness, it's an area I intend to explore in the future. Adding responsive features would make the page accessible on various devices, such as phones, tablets, and smaller screens.
